## Problem 1: Rational numbers

We’re going to do zero knowledge addition again.

Claim: “I know two rational numbers that add up to num/den”

Proof: ([A], [B], num, den)







## Problem 2: Matrix Multiplication

There is no claim statement here, just execute the math on chain.

Your contract should implement matrix multiplication of an n x n matrix (**M**) of uint256 and a n x 1 vector of points (**s**). It validates the claim that matrix **Ms = o** where o is a n x 1 matrix of uint256.
